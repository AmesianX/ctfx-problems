Uses ECB mode encryption, so just need to construct a cookie that decrypts to something with "admin" true

Can do it by sending JSON encoding requests to set values to true

For ex:

{"username": "a"
, "password": "r
", "aaaaaaaaaaaa
admin": true}

Copy the last encrypted chunk- because it would decrypt to 'admin": true'

and append it to the first 3 encrypted chunks of

{"username": "a"
, "password": "r
rrrrrrrrrrrr", "
wtvr": "a"}

to get something that decrypts to:

{"username": "a", "password": "rrrrrrrrrrrrr", "admin": true}
