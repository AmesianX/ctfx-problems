The blue values in shed.png all have either 0s or 1s as their ones
digit. Constructing a black and white image with these ones and zeroes
show larger black and white squares, which can be read as:

00011101010110111011111010110101010100101101011111100010000111111001000010100000011000010111101000001000011101010111000111000011011111011111101101100100001101110111111010101010011001100011101110010010101010000110100110001011100100110111010110100001101111111100100111000100100000001111000110011111100100010011001111010001000101100000100100011

The problem title and description lead to arithmetic coding. Using
letter frequencies with arithmetic coding decodes the binary string
to a message giving the flag.
