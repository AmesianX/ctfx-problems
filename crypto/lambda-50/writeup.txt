The scrambler will do the same operations on strings of the same length. 
Scramble a string with unique characters that is the same length of the ciphertext. 
Match the corresponding letters and positions with the ciphertext to get the flag.

Another solution is to continue to scramble the ciphertext because the function is cyclic. 
Run the ciphertext through until you get the flag.
